# Content Guidelines - Legal Compliance and Voice

Applies to all blog posts, articles, landing pages, and comparison content across the VRA gateway site network.

## Australian Consumer Law (ACL) Compliance

- All content must comply with Australian Consumer Law
- No misleading or deceptive statements
- All factual claims must be reasonably supportable
- If a claim cannot be verified, mark it with `[VERIFY]` - never present it as fact
- When discussing pricing, features, or capabilities, language must reflect that information may change

## Pricing Rules

- All pricing claims require **two independent, publicly available sources**, cited explicitly in the draft
- All pricing must include a publication or verification date
- Indicate that pricing may change
- Do not present estimated prices as guaranteed or exact
- Standard disclaimer on all pricing content: "Pricing accurate at time of publication. Software vendors may change pricing without notice. Verify current pricing directly with the vendor before making purchasing decisions."

## Competitor Comparisons

- Competitors may be named in factual comparisons
- Focus on features, licensing models, workflows, or documented differences
- No defamatory, insulting, or disparaging language
- No absolute superiority claims - use conditional language
- Good: "Some organisations may prefer Product A because it offers a perpetual licence model."
- Bad: "Product A is better than Product B."

## Healthcare and Medical Content

Content must NOT imply that software: improves patient outcomes, provides clinical advice, is a medical device, or is clinically validated - unless verified and documented.

Preferred wording: "Designed to assist documentation workflows." / "Often used by clinicians to support administrative documentation."

## Evidence and Statistics

- Never invent statistics, research findings, survey results, quotes, testimonials, or case studies
- If a statistic is used, cite a credible source
- If source cannot be confirmed, mark with `[VERIFY SOURCE]`

## Authority Language

All authority claims about VRA and Russell Bewsell must come from `src/data/link-network.json` -> `authority` block. Never improvise credentials. If a claim is not in that block, do not use it.

## Voice and Tone

Authoritative, friendly, direct, honest. Australian spelling throughout.

**Avoid:** best, ultimate, guaranteed, revolutionary, perfect, proven, world-class, supercharge, game-changing

**Prefer:** may help, can assist, commonly used for, designed to support, often chosen for, practical, straightforward, reliable

## Content Approval Workflow

1. Owner instructs Claude to draft content
2. Claude drafts in chat - does NOT commit
3. Claude flags any `[VERIFY]` items
4. Claude suggests anchor text options - owner chooses
5. Owner reviews and approves
6. Owner says "commit it"
7. Claude generates images (with owner approval) then commits article + images together

**Claude must NEVER:** commit without approval, delete files without confirmation, modify pricing without verified sources, generate images autonomously, invent statistics or testimonials, override these guidelines.
