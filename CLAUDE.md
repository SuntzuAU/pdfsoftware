# CLAUDE.md — Mandatory Pre-Build Instructions

This file is read by every Claude session working on any VRA gateway site repo. **Read this entire file before doing anything else.**

---

## CRITICAL RULES — NEVER VIOLATE THESE

1. **voicerecognition.com.au is the PRIMARY 25-year Shopify ecommerce site.** It is NOT a gateway site. Never redesign or replace it. Gateway sites link TO it for purchasing.
2. **Never invent domains.** Only use the verified list in `src/data/link-network.json`.
3. **No footer links. Ever.** All cross-site and internal links must be contextual — woven naturally into body copy.
4. **Never commit content without explicit owner approval.** Draft in chat first, wait for "commit it".
5. **Never use emoji or special Unicode in `site.config.json`.** GitHub API corrupts them during base64 encoding, breaking Astro builds.
6. **Never use a separate Nav component** that depends on importing pages to define CSS variables. Use the dragonprofessional16 self-contained single-file pattern.
7. **`push_files` cannot modify `.github/workflows/` files.** Provide content for manual paste via GitHub web editor.
8. **CSS variable rule:** Never use `var(--primary)` or `var(--accent)` for `background-color` on dark sections in `[product].astro`. Extract colours in frontmatter as JS variables and apply via inline style.

## MANDATORY PRE-BUILD CHECKLIST

Before writing a single line of code or content, read these files **in this order**:

1. `CLAUDE.md` — this file (you are reading it)
2. `src/data/link-network.json` — full network config, anchor pools, AND authority language for VRA/Russell
3. `src/site.config.json` — this site's content, colours, products, CTAs
4. `src/data/link-usage.json` — what has already been linked from this site (anchor text already used)
5. `src/content/news/` — existing blog posts (check slugs, context tags, existing links)

Only after reading all five may you proceed.

**Why this matters:** The dictationsolutions.com.au build was severely broken because a prior session skipped these files and invented its own structure from scratch. Every structural mistake in that build traced back to not reading the reference files. Do not repeat this.

---

## AUTHORITY LANGUAGE

All authority claims about VRA and Russell Bewsell **must come from `src/data/link-network.json` -> `authority` block**. Never improvise credentials, statistics, or claim language. If a claim is not in that block, do not use it.

---

## ARCHITECTURE PATTERN

The reference pattern for all page builds is `dragonprofessional16.com.au`. Key rules:

- Single self-contained `index.astro` — no separate Nav component
- All content driven from `src/site.config.json`
- Product subpages use `[product].astro` dynamic route
- Images served from Cloudflare R2 via `PUBLIC_R2_BASE` env var
- Blog posts in `src/content/news/` with required frontmatter (see link-network.json rules)

---

## DEPLOYMENT

- Hosting: Cloudflare Pages
- Both apex domain AND `www` must be added as custom domains in the Pages project
- `PUBLIC_R2_BASE` must be set in BOTH GitHub Actions secrets AND Cloudflare Pages environment variables
- Value: `https://pub-c7a09e1ddb7c45e6a38fcdca1e4b6897.r2.dev`
- Touching `src/site.config.json` forces a full rebuild when Cloudflare serves stale cache

---

## IMAGE GENERATION

- Worker URL: `https://master-image-generator.speech-recognition-cloud.workers.dev/generate`
- **Never call the image generation Worker autonomously.** Always prepare prompts, show Russ exactly what will be called, wait for manual trigger.
- SEO filename format: `seo-slug-uuid.png` (slug first)

---

## CONTENT APPROVAL WORKFLOW

1. Owner instructs Claude to draft content
2. Claude drafts in chat — does NOT commit
3. Claude flags any `[VERIFY]` items
4. Claude suggests anchor text options for cross-site links — owner chooses
5. Owner reviews and approves
6. Owner says "commit it"
7. Claude commits — Cloudflare deploys automatically

**Blog posts require draft approval before committing. Code bug fixes may be committed directly with immediate notification to owner.**
