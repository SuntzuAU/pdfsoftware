# CLAUDE.md - Mandatory Pre-Build Instructions

This file is read by every Claude session working on any VRA gateway site repo. **Read this entire file before doing anything else.**

---

## CRITICAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE THESE

1. **voicerecognition.com.au is the PRIMARY 25-year Shopify ecommerce site.** It is NOT a gateway site. Never redesign or replace it. Gateway sites link TO it for purchasing.
2. **Never invent domains.** Only use the verified list in `src/data/link-network.json`.
3. **No footer links. Ever.** All cross-site and internal links must be contextual - woven naturally into body copy.
4. **Never commit content without explicit owner approval.** Draft in chat first, wait for "commit it".
5. **Never use emoji or special Unicode in `site.config.json`.** GitHub API corrupts them during base64 encoding, breaking Astro builds.
6. **Never use a separate Nav component** that depends on importing pages to define CSS variables. Use the dragonprofessional16 self-contained single-file pattern.
7. **`push_files` cannot modify `.github/workflows/` files.** Provide content for manual paste via GitHub web editor.
8. **CSS variable rule:** Never use `var(--primary)` or `var(--accent)` for `background-color` on dark sections in `[product].astro`. Extract colours in frontmatter as JS variables and apply via inline style.

## MANDATORY PRE-BUILD CHECKLIST

Before writing a single line of code or content, read these files **in this order**:

1. `CLAUDE.md` - this file (you are reading it)
2. `CONTENT-GUIDELINES.md` - legal compliance, ACL rules, medical content restrictions, pricing verification, linking rules, voice/tone
3. `src/data/link-network.json` - full network config, anchor pools, authority language for VRA/Russell, bridge phrases
4. `src/site.config.json` - this site's content, colours, products, CTAs
5. `src/data/link-usage.json` - what has already been linked from this site (anchor text already used)
6. `src/content/news/` - existing blog posts (check slugs, context tags, existing links)

Only after reading all six may you proceed.

## LEGAL COMPLIANCE - AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW

All content must comply with Australian Consumer Law (ACL). Full rules are in `CONTENT-GUIDELINES.md`. Key points:

- No misleading or deceptive statements
- No absolute superiority claims ("best", "guaranteed", "proven")
- All pricing requires two independent sources and a verification date
- Include pricing disclaimer on all pricing content
- Mark unverified claims with `[VERIFY]` - never present them as fact
- Healthcare content must not imply clinical outcomes, patient safety improvements, or medical device status
- Never invent statistics, research findings, quotes, testimonials, or case studies

---

## AUTHORITY LANGUAGE

All authority claims about VRA and Russell Bewsell **must come from `src/data/link-network.json` -> `authority` block**. Never improvise credentials, statistics, or claim language. If a claim is not in that block, do not use it.

---

## CONTENT COLLECTION STANDARD

All blog/news content goes in `src/content/news/`. The Astro content collection is named `news`.

- Content folder: `src/content/news/`
- Collection name in config.ts: `news`
- Page routes: `src/pages/news/` and `src/pages/news.astro`
- URL pattern: `/news/post-slug`

Do NOT create or use a `blog` collection or `src/content/blog/` folder.

---

## BLOG POST IMAGE REQUIREMENT - MANDATORY, NO EXCEPTIONS

Every blog post MUST have three images. Image generation is NEVER autonomous - always show prompts to owner and wait for approval before calling the Worker.

**Worker endpoint:**
```
POST https://master-image-generator.speech-recognition-cloud.workers.dev/generate
Body: { "prompt": "...", "name": "seo-slug-here" }
```

**If Chrome MCP is unavailable:** inform the owner and wait - do NOT commit the article without images.

---

## INTERLINK SYSTEM

Every blog post must include cross-site and internal links. Before writing any content:

1. Read `src/data/link-network.json` for anchor pools, bridge phrases, and adjacency map
2. Read `src/data/link-usage.json` for this site's coverage counts and anchors already used
3. Target the external site with the lowest coverage count AND a relevant topic match
4. Every post: min 1 internal link, min 1 external link (max 3 internal, max 2 external)
5. Never link to the same external site twice on one page
6. All links contextual in body copy - NO footer links ever
7. Declare all links in frontmatter (internalLinks + externalLinks)
8. Present anchor text choices to owner before committing
9. Include "Links used" summary at end of every draft

Full interlink rules are in `CONTENT-GUIDELINES.md` and `src/data/link-network.json`.
